#+TITLE: Dotfiles

These dotfiles are tailored for my preferences running Omarchy.
Multiple aspects of these configs build on top on the omarchy defaults, hence these will not work well on any other distro without major changes.

** Contents

This repository contains:
- Package installation scripts, managed through =omarchy-packages/=
- Configuration files for =nix=, =hypr=, and other applications
- Personal shell scripts in =bin/=
- A unified =dotfiles= management script for syncing configs and installing packages

** Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to =~/git/dotfiles=:
  #+begin_src bash
  mkdir -p ~/git
  git clone https://github.com/ThonyPrice/dotfiles.git ~/
  #+end_src

2. Install GNU Stow (required for symlinking configs):
  #+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S stow
  #+end_src

3. Stow the bin scripts to make the =dotfiles= command available:
  #+begin_src bash
  cd ~/git/dotfiles
  ./bin/stow-bin
  #+end_src

4. Install packages:
  #+begin_src bash
  dotfiles packages install
  #+end_src

5. Sync your configurations:
