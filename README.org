Ansible playbook to configure and customize systems. ðŸ’»
The purpose is a single command to configure systems in an repeatable way.

The playbook is compatible with:

- Arch systems
- MacOS /(work in progress)/

* Description

The meat of this repository is a giant Ansible playbook.
It defines /my personal/ system configuration including roles, programs, config, etc.

The playbook is bootstrapped by one command in ~/bin/dotfiles.sh~.
It achieves three things:

1. Install Ansible (if not present).
2. Create `.ssh` directory and keys (if not present).
3. Run the Ansible playbook...

** The Playbook

Depending on the host, the playbook run any of the roles:

- base :: Configuration suitable for all systems.
- workstation :: This configuration is applied on top of =base= for non-server systems.

Both roles include tasks that:
- Configure the system (e.g. keybindings, themes, package manager)
- Install all defined programs and software (e.g. editors, development tooling)
- Symlink defined configurations (i.e. dotfiles)
- Configures all users

** Prerequisites

*Future work:* Automate these tasks within the Ansible play.

Pull Ansible packages used in the play:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
``` shell
$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements
```
#+END_SRC shell

** Post Playbook

These tasks are required after the playbook to finalize some installation/configuration.

*Future work:* Similar to the prerequisites, these should be automated within the playbook.

Finalize the Doom Emacs installation:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
``` shell
$ ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
```
#+END_SRC shell

* What's Included?

This segment provide a brief description of setup and configs.

** Spicetify

Theming utility for spotify client.

* Tooling To be Included

These tools are currently in a testing phase and might be included in the future.
